        first consumer grade comcorder in 2012. However I was limited to the the automatic 
        settings, which is why acquiring a DSLR while notreally intended for video, allowed me 
        to expand my knowledge in videography. However it was not just the camera techniques
        that I gained an understanding of. I also realised the importance of good lighting and a

       <p>Hello my name is Adam Lubin I am currently studying Multimedia Computing Student at Coventry University. So far I am enjoying my time here at the university and feel that I have gained major support from both the lectures and my fellow students. The reason I chose Multimedia Computing was down to the potential work opportunities that become available as a multimedia computing graduate. In addition to this someone like myself has both an interest in creativity as well as the technical aspects of computer science, so Multimedia Computing was the right course for me as it does a good job of bringing these two aspects into one course. What made Coventry University stand out from others was its wide range of facilities and up to date software as we are now living in an age where technology is rapidly evolving so it comes as a great advantage to myself and other students to have access to the latest and greatest. So far the course has offered a range of interesting modules. In the first year I was able to gain an understanding of the underpinning of computer science, which involved modules such as Computer Architecture which breaks down which covered how hardware operates and communicates through each other through binary and assembly language. I was also able to get to grips with common programming languages such as Python, which is considered by many as a great language for entry level programmers as well as C# which I used in conjunction with Unity Engine to create a 2D game in first semester which then gave me the knowledge to create a 3D game in the second semester of the first year (more information on that can be found from the University/Portfolio page). Towards the end of the first years and the beginning of the second, the course became more multimedia cantered. So modules such as 3D modelling and Animation as well as Usability and Digital Media were courses that I feel really allowed me to go above and beyond giving me the freedom to be creative, rather than feeling tied down to complete a specific task. </p>
