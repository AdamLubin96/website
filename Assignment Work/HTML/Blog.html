      Activity Lead Learning Project
    </h2>
     <p111>
       Coventry University recently implemented a new module known as activity lead learning or ALL. The
       idea behind it was to give students the opportunity to develop theri soft skills by working in, 
       groups to meet the requirements of a given breif. The ALL module overlaped itself into other modules,
       so these modules would have a weighting of ALL which contributed to the final grade of that module. So it,
       was important to use the skills and knowledge gained in other modulesa and apply it to the ALL project.

    <h3> Digital Media </h3>
     <p222>
       From a person who likes to bridge the gap between craetivity and scientific principles, I forund Digital
       Media to be a course that really allowed me to work beyond the requirements of the breif and learn new
       skills whilst doing so.
