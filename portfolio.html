 <h2>
      Activity Lead Learning Project
    </h2>
     <p>
       Coventry University recently implemented a new module known as activity lead learning or ALL. The
       idea behind it was to give students the opportunity to develop theri soft skills by working in, 
       groups to meet the requirements of a given breif. The ALL module overlaped itself into other modules,
       so these modules would have a weighting of ALL which contributed to the final grade of that module. So it,
       was important to use the skills and knowledge gained in other modulesa and apply it to the ALL project.
    </p>

       <h2>
      First Year Modules
    </h2>

    <h> Computer Architecture </h>
    <p> This module covered the basics of computer hardware an assembly language. From this I could gain 
      an understanding of how logic gates and Boolean operators. Throughout the module, I was also able 
       to also gain an understanding of how the processer handles processes as well as how instructions 
      are fetched from main memory. </p>

    <h> Introduction to Computing </h>
    <p> This module gave us an insight to learning the fundamental basic of programming. The chosen 
      language for this module was python and throughout it I gained an understanding of how Boolean 
      operations work in code as well as conditional statements with loops. Further throughout the 
      module I gained an understanding of more complex methods in python such as recursive function 
      and different data structures and types. Towards the end of the module, the idea of object oriented  
       using classes and inheritance.</p>

    <h> Logic and Sets </h>
    <p> This module was mainly based on mathematics, but was relatable to computing as it helped gain an
      understanding of computer architecture. The module mainly covered the concept of truth tables,  
        handling data as well as algorithms which were mainly for mathematical scenarios.  </p>

    <h> Design Tools and Techniques </h>
    <p> This module was one of the first (apart from ALL) of the creative set that was relatable to the 
      multimedia computing degree. The module allowed me to explorer the idea of 2D and 3D animation 
      as well as 3D modelling. This module was then assessed with a phase test which consisted of 
       creating a poster for a film as well as a portfolio of creative work, which used methods that we 
       learned on the course. </p>

    <h> Introduction to Algorithms </h>
    <p> This module was a building block from introduction to computing. This module explored further 
      concepts within python, such as the ability to use the Tkinter module which allows you to created 
       GUI elements as well as the SQLite feature which is used for databases. The module also gave me an 
       insight to algorithms used in programming which would be something that I would cover in more 
      depth in my year 2 module (Algorithms and data structures) </p>

    <h> Usability</h>
    <p> This module was less about just computer itself and more about how the user interacts with either 
      hardware and software and the experience whilst doing so, which is something that is crucial when it 
      comes to any form of design </p>
